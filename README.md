# CherryTree HTML Template

I created a new template for CherryTree HTML export with changing CSS and JS files into **res/** directory. You can easily copy and paste above files into **res/** directory and open **index.html** file via browser.

## What is the CherryTree
A hierarchical note taking application, featuring rich text and syntax highlighting, storing data in either a single file (xml or sqlite) or multiple files and directories.
You can download it from https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/


## How to use
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hunThubSpace/CherryTree_HTML_Template.git
```

2. Export your document as html
